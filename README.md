# ML-pedriatic-growth
This study explores the transformative role of machine learning (ML) in pediatric growth assessment, emphasizing the early diagnosis and monitoring of growth disorders. A logistic regression algorithm, developed using R, analyzes biometric and demographic data to identify anomalies in children's growth patterns. The study employs a cross-sectional dataset comprising real-world data and references from reputable sources to model growth variations in children aged 6 to 13. The results suggest that logistic regression significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosing growth anomalies compared to traditional methods.
